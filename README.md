- 👋 Hi, I’m Anders Høgsbro Madsen @ the Danish company Novolog Informationssystemer A/S.
- 👀 I am an architect of database-centered systems, and I also develop them. My core skills are: Analyze what are the customers' needs and how else a system can help them. Create the database (and create a Windows user interface if desired). Secondarily, I work with web developers who create an interface to "my" databases. I integrate with email, pivot tables in spreadsheets, etc. I train customers' employees in my systems and am a very responsible third level supporter of the systems I have built.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new systems where an analyzer is needed to ensure that the built system is not only what the customer thinks he wants, but also what will really bring him success. Currently, unfortunately I don't have time for new projects.
